# Inferencing Custom Models for Generalized Image Quality Detection
This repository stores the notebooks containing code written for inferencing custom models that we had trained, the pretrained models are stored in ``` models/``` directory. This repository is an additional resource for inferencing as mentioned in the blog "Building a General Classification System for Image Quality Defects"()
1. ``` models/ ``` contains custom trained CNN models for both blur and glare detection.
2. ``` images/ ``` contains images that have been inferenced in the given notebooks.
3.  Refer to ``` glare.ipynb ``` for inferencing of the custom glare model, along with two helper functions specifically created to help you leverage the potential of these models with ease.
4.  Refer to ``` blur.ipynb ``` for inferencing of the custom blur model.
