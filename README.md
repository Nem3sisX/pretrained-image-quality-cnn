# Inferencing Custom Models for Generalized Image Quality Detection
This repository stores the notebooks containing code written for inferencing custom models that we had trained, the pretrained models are stored in ``` models/``` directory. This repository is an additional resource for inferencing as mentioned in the blog ***"Building a General Classification System for Image Quality Defects"*** (https://medium.com/@trapti.kalra_ibm/building-a-general-classification-system-for-image-quality-defects-beadbe026a19)
1. ``` models/ ``` contains custom trained CNN models for both blur and glare detection.
2. ``` images/ ``` contains images that have been inferenced in the given notebooks.
3.  Refer to ``` glare.ipynb ``` for inferencing of the custom glare model, along with **two helper functions** specifically created to help you leverage the potential of these models with ease. This also contains notes to help you navigate the notebook.
4.  Refer to ``` blur.ipynb ``` for inferencing of the **custom blur model**.
